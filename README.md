# CALIN: Composable Asynchronous Logic Integrase Networks

CALIN permits automatization of design of integrase based logic gates, either for Boolean and History-dependent programs. Designs follow the framework corresponding to the pre-print paper: https://doi.org/10.1101/150987. 
These scripts permits the generation of the biological design as cartoon and the DNA sequence. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
