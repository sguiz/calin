# CALIN: Composable Asynchronous Logic Integrase Networks

CALIN permits automatization of design of integrase based logic gates, either for Boolean and History-dependent programs. Designs follow the framework corresponding to the pre-print paper: https://doi.org/10.1101/150987. 
These scripts permits the generation of the genetic layout of the biological design (using dnaplotlib, [Der et al, ACS Synbio 2016](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00252) and the DNA sequence.

## Installing

CALIN code requires Python 2.7 and installation of DNAplotlib, biopython and matplotlib 1.2 or newer. 
For biopython, please download the module at http://biopython.org/wiki/Download and to install: pip install biopython.
For DNAplotlib, please download the python code at https://github.com/VoigtLab/dnaplotlib and add the file to your calin directory.

To use CALIN, download all python files and place them to a single python diectory (with DNAplotlib).
